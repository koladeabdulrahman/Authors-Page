# Authors-Page
This project is a dynamic web page displaying freeCodeCamp News authors, built with HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+). It fetches author data from a RESTful API using the Fetch API, integrating backend services to populate the UI. The application features modular development with reusable functions for rendering author cards and handling pagination via a "Load More" button, ensuring scalable architecture and efficient data loading. State management is handled through global variables for tracking indices and data arrays, promoting code readability and maintainability. Error handling is implemented to display user-friendly messages on fetch failures, while CSS uses flexbox for layout and variables for theming, optimizing for cross-browser compatibility and performance.
